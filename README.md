# Point-Based-Tennis-Prediction

## Code

Now organized into chapters which can be independently run.

## New Data

"New" relative to the data in the archive directory. All from [Jeff Sackmannâ€™s GitHub](https://github.com/JeffSackmann). Title of directory cannot be changed without making corresponding changes in the Jupyter notebooks under the Code directory.

## Misc.

Even though the language breakdown describes the project as almost all Jupyter notebook, the majority of analysis is done in R and stored in the various .Rmd files. This issue is outlined here: https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/issues/5208. Python is only used for preparing the data for analysis and extracting aggregate stats. The real language breakdown would be in the ballpark of 70% R and 30% Python.
